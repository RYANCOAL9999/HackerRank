The owner of a parking lot has come up with a system to change the face of parking using AI.They have written an AI service that automatically captures the vehicle number a long with the timestamp when a car enters the lot.

At the exit, there is just one person sitting in a booth, and their only tasks is to collect the parking fee. The attendant does not have to make any entries as the whole parking fee calculation system is automated.

Even though revluttionary, the owner does not know how this service can fit into a whole system to make this automated parking system work and to end.

Design a scalable system design for a web app that uses this AI service to automate the whole parking experience flawlessly.

Components:
A cloud service like AWS/GCP/Azure.
An AI service capable of capturing vehicle numbers during entry and exit at the parking lot.
A web app to show the amount to be charged.
